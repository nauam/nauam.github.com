# Projects

A project is a place to organize all management, automation, and orchestration activity. These activities take place in the context of a project. Several projects can be maintained on the same QW Control server, configured to work with high availability (cluster) and backups.

Projects are independent of each other, so you can use them to organize unrelated systems into a single QW Control installation. This can be useful to manage different teams, infrastructures, environments or applications, including using your company's AD (Active Direct).

Projects can be [archived](/en/administration/projects/project-archive.md) and imported to other QW Control servers to help
promote changes between environments.

A new installation will not contain any projects, so QW Control will present a dialog box to create a new one.

[Documentation for managing projects can be found here.](/en/administration/projects/)
