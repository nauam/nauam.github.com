# QW Control Introduction

## What is QW Control?

QW Control is a job automation and orchestration tool capable of executing in an organized and scheduled way, varied commands (bath, shell) on machines (nodes), through the use of a communication network using different protocols (ssh, FTP(s) ), HTTP(s)).

QW Control was born from the need to automate manual work and routines, with security and use of encryption, log storage and user access control.

When used for general operations work, QW Control will help alleviate time-consuming and repetitive work that currently consumes a lot of your IT staff's time when out of business.

This means that we can control for example from a simple database backup, file transfers between servers, to complex ETL jobs and robotic process automation. Try using our plugins or do it yourself, in python or java, your own for integration with legacy systems.

With QW Control, it is simple and easy to create workflows (called "jobs") from any of your existing tools or scripts. Trigger QW Control jobs from the Web GUI, API, CLI, or by schedule. QW Control's access control features make it easy to safely delegate control of tasks to those traditionally outside of operations.

QW Control was designed to accept the reality that heterogeneous infrastructure and tooling are a fact of life in any sizable organization. That is why QW Control doesn't make you replace the scripts, commands, or tools you use today. You use QW Control to execute workflows across your existing automation (e.g., Ansible, Puppet, Chef, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, legacy tools, and all of your custom scripts/APIs) or quickly automate previously manual procedures. With QW Control you can reuse the automation skills you already have and add new ones as needed.

Out of the box, QW Control gives you capabilities that would be expensive to develop and maintain in-house: workflow control, scheduling, error-handling, logging, access control, option passing, log filtering, web GUI, REST API (with CLI tools) and integration with external sources for authentication, resource model, and option data.
